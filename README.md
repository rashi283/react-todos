## React Todo List

The goal of this exercise is to create a working todo list with persistent data storage.

To start with, we have a styled todo list that supports adding todos. We also have premade styles for completed todo items. Although there's no working mechanism for "completing" a todo.

## Requirements

1. Clicking on a todo item should toggle the "checked" state. ✅
2. The todo list state should be saved and loaded from local storage. ✅
3. Checked items should sink to the bottom of the list automatically ✅

## Stretch Goals

1. Allow todos to be deleted. When you hover your mouse over a todo, an X should appear on the far right side, clicking the X should remove it from the list. ✅

2. Add hidden timestamps to todos (createdAt, completedAt), these will be used for sorting
- The active todos should be sorted by createdAt descending ✅
- The completed todos should be sorted by completedAt ascending ✅
